Dear  John,

I'm just sending this email to share my habits with you and ask for some advice about living there. I am pleased to be your roommate. Here are my habits.

First and foremost, I really love doing cardio exercise. Doing cardio is my daily routine, which helps me burn calories, slim down and keep fit. If you prefer exercise too, we can exercise together.


What's more, I love eating out rather than cooking at home, so can you give me some local foods?

Most important of all, to help me adapt to life there smoothly, can you give me some advice about the local food, transportation and customs?

I am looking forward to your reply and seeing you quickly.


Yours Sincerely,

Li Ming.
