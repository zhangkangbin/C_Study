Dear John
I am LiMing, an exchange student from China.  It is my pleasure to be your roommate for the coming year. I would like to write this email to share with you my living habits and ask for some practical advice about living there.

First and foremost, I prefer to eat out rather than cook dinner at home. Besides, I really like to exercise. Doing cardio is my daily routine.  If you like exercise too, we can exercise together.

What's more, can you tell me some local living habits? 

First and foremost, one of my hobbies is tasting international cuisine, so I prefer to eat out rather than cook at home.  What's more, doing cardio is my daily routine, which helps me burn calories, slim down and keep fit. If you happen to be fanatic, we can exercise together.

I appreciate your kindness in advance.  Looking forward to your reply.

Your Sincerely,

Li Ming
